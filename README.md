# SpoofDPI plugin for Decky Loader

An anti-censorship tool for Decky Loaader. Just for the occasions where your ISP really don't want you to use Steam for some reason.

Out of the box config should be good for most use cases, but you can always tweak them as necessary.

This project is a wrapper around [SpoofDPI](https://github.com/xvzc/SpoofDPI)
